## Overview

The Quadrant Compose App displays information about Composable functions on a single screen divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant highlights:

The name of a Composable function

A one-sentence description of its purpose

This exercise challenges you to apply your existing knowledge while exploring additional Modifier classes and properties.

## Features

Divided screen layout with four quadrants

Informative display for each Composable function

Clean and visually appealing design

Hands-on learning of new Modifiers and properties

Getting Started
